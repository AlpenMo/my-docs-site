# Welcome to S&C Associate's Demo Knowledge Base
This is just a demo site to show what an online S&C Knowledge Base could look like. It's pretty bare bones right now, but it's capable of a lot more. You can ignore what the URL is right now, we can change it later. The best part about this site? Totally free.  

You can check out a more robust version of this site [here].

I've added a small section from our "Welcome!" folder just as a demo. This site supports images, but I haven't included any yet. It's written in what's called [Markdown], which is a simple markup language used across the web.  

### But why?
Mostly because the system of Word docs stashed in Dropbox folders drives me a little nuts üêøÔ∏è. It's hard to find what you're looking for, and there's no good way to organize content in a logical manner. Instead, we can use a documentation site like this to group content together and make it easier to find (for example, a SWPP section that goes through how to add SWPP BMPs to a design file and a setup section that goes over how to set up Plan Sheets). Everything would be navigatable from the side bar and possibly searchable (I haven't tried the search feature yet, no idea if it's any good). 

### Any other reason?
Yes! This also uses Github, which is a version control software that makes it really easy to collaborate and make changes to a document. It's owned by Microsoft and used throughout the tech industry. It's really stable, and it offers a nifty feature called Github pages (that's the site that's hosting this site). I don't know how to build and deploy a website on my own, but Github makes it super easy. With Github, you can easily see what changes have been made, and you can roll back any changes that you want to undo. 

### Any other other reasons?
I just like writing docs this way üôÉ

### Any downsides?
Github doesn't have a spellchecker built in üòñ. Also, there's a way to make a fully custom domain (without the "github.io" part), but I'm not sure how to do it. I think the final version would be something like sandcassociates.github.io/knowledge-base, or whatever we decide on.
